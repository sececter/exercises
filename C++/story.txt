This is just a stupid little story with no meaning whatsoever. The wolf
came out of his den and chased little red hood, found her and pounced on 
her. Little red hood cried, "the wolf!", just stepped aside and the 
wolf cracked his neck on the pavement, his brain in pulp. 
She was to hear of him no more.
